Using `$route` in your component creates a tight coupling with the route which limits the flexibility of the component as it can only be used on certain URLs.

To decouple this component from the router use option `props`:

**Instead of coupling to `$route`:**

``` js
const User = {
  template: '<div>User {{ $route.params.id }}</div>'
}
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/user/:id', component: User }
  ]
})
```

**Decouple it by using `props`**

``` js
const User = {
  props: ['id'],
  template: '<div>User {{ id }}</div>'
}
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/user/:id', component: User, props: true },

    // for routes with named views, you have to define the `props` option for each named view:
    {
      path: '/user/:id',
      components: { default: User, sidebar: Sidebar },
      props: { default: true, sidebar: false }
    }
  ]
})
```

This allows you to use the component anywhere, which makes the component easier to reuse and test.

## Boolean mode

When `props` is set to `true`, the `route.params` will be set as the component props.

## Object mode

When `props` is an object, this will be set as the component props as-is. Useful for when the props are static.

``` js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/promotion/from-newsletter', component: Promotion, props: { newsletterPopup: false } }
  ]
})
```

## Function mode

You can create a function that returns props. This allows you to cast parameters into other types, combine static values with route-based values, etc.

``` js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/search', component: SearchUser, props: (route) => ({ query: route.query.q }) }
  ]
})
```

The URL `/search?q=vue` would pass `{query: 'vue'}` as props to the `SearchUser` component.

Try to keep the `props` function stateless, as it's only evaluated on route changes. Use a wrapper component if you need state to define the props, that way vue can react to state changes.
